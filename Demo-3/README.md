The owner of a startup offers other companies to participate in the financing of his startup. In return the buyer receives the corresponding amount of shares from the startup.
</p>
<strong>Business logic:</strong>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The Startup Business System is intended to be used by business organizations (international companies)</li>
<li>Each company can create and offer to the others many startups</li>
<li>The participant makes an offer to the owner of the current startup</li>
<li>The owner of the startup can accept the current offer completely or just a part of it. In case the offer is made by a company with questionable reputation, the owner of the startup can refuse the offer</li>
<li>As an owner of the startup, the current company possess the majority of the shares, so it  cannot participate and make offers to its own startups </li>
</ul>
